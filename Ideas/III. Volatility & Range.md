9. Volatility Level — “uncertainty”

Idea: higher volatility = more uncertainty

Typical form:

ts_std_dev(returns,n)

Insight:

High vol → risky, noisy
Low vol → stable signals
10. Volatility Expansion — “big move coming”

Idea: volatility increasing → regime change

Typical form:

ts_std_dev(returns,short) / ts_std_dev(returns,long)

Insight:

Precedes breakouts
Signals transitions
11. Range Compression — “energy buildup”

Idea: low volatility → potential breakout

Typical form:

1 / ts_std_dev(returns,n)

Insight:

Setup, not trigger
Works with breakout signals
